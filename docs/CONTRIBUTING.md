## Finding ways to contribute

A great way to contribute is to scan the [Compatibility Matrix](/docs/compatibility.md) for unsupported features and improving compatibility with CosmosDB.

A part from that, the [Issues page](https://github.com/pikami/cosmium/issues) might contain issues registered by other users. Fixing reported issues is a great way to contribute.

## How to Contribute

1. **Create an Issue**: Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please create an issue or look for existing ones on the [Issues page](https://github.com/pikami/cosmium/issues) to discuss your proposed changes. This allows us to provide feedback and ensure that your contribution aligns with the project goals.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Once you have identified an issue to work on, fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes using a descriptive name that reflects the issue you are addressing.

4. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Reference the issue number in the commit message. **Please write unit tests for your implemented feature!**

5. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository. Be sure to include a detailed description of your changes and reference the relevant issue.

6. **Review and Collaborate**: Participate in the code review process by addressing any feedback or comments from maintainers. Collaboration and constructive feedback help ensure the quality of contributions.
